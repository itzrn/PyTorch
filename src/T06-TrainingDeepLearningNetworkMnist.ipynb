Here are some sample images from the dataset:\n\n![mnist-sample](https://i.imgur.com/CAYnuo1.jpg)\n\nWe noticed that it's quite challenging to improve the accuracy of a logistic regression model beyond 87%, since the model assumes a linear relationship between pixel intensities and image labels.

Each of these is called a _layer_ in the network. \n\n* The first layer (also known as the hidden layer) will transform the input matrix of shape `batch_size x 784` into an intermediate output matrix of shape `batch_size x hidden_size`. The parameter `hidden_size` can be configured manually (e.g., 32 or 64).\n\n* We'll then apply a non-linear *activation function* to the intermediate outputs. The activation function transforms individual elements of the matrix.\n\n* The result of the activation function, which is also of size `batch_size x hidden_size`, is passed into the second layer (also known as the output layer).  The second layer transforms it into a matrix of size `batch_size x 10`.

We also used the ReLU activation function to introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex relationships between the inputs (pixel densities) and outputs (class probabilities).\n\n* We defined some utilities like `get_default_device`, `to_device` and `DeviceDataLoader` to leverage a GPU if available, by moving the input data and model parameters to the appropriate device.\n\n* We were able to use the exact same training loop: the `fit` function we had define earlier to train out model and evaluate it using the validation dataset.\n\n\n* Try building a model for a different dataset, such as the [CIFAR10 or CIFAR100 datasets](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).\n\nHere are some references for further reading:\n\n* [A visual proof that neural networks can compute any function](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html), also known as the Universal Approximation Theorem.\n\n* [But what *is* a neural network?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) - A visual and intuitive introduction to what neural networks are and what the intermediate layers represent\n\n* [Stanford CS229 Lecture notes on Backpropagation](https://github.com/BirajCoder/File-host-repo/blob/main/backprop.pdf) - for a more mathematical treatment of how gradients are calculated and weights are updated for neural networks with multiple layers.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'T06_TrainingDeepLearningNetworkMnist.pth')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T11:04:11.101807Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T11:04:11.102206Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T11:04:11.112965Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T11:04:11.102176Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T11:04:11.111807Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
