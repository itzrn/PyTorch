The parameter `hidden_size` can be configured manually (e.g., 32 or 64).\n\n* We'll then apply a non-linear *activation function* to the intermediate outputs. The activation function transforms individual elements of the matrix.\n\n* The result of the activation function, which is also of size `batch_size x hidden_size`, is passed into the second layer (also known as the output layer).  The second layer transforms it into a matrix of size `batch_size x 10`.
