Here's quick recap of the topics:\n* Introduction to the CIFAR10 dataset for image classification\n* Downloading, extracing and loading an image dataset using `torchvision`\n* Show random batches of images in a grid using `torchvision.utils.make_grid`\n* Creating a convolutional neural network using with `nn.Conv2d` and `nn.MaxPool2d` layers\n* Training a convolutional neural network and visualizing the losses and errors\n* Understanding overfitting and the strategies for avoiding it (more on this later)\n* Generating predictions on single images from the test set\n\nThere's a lot of scope to experiment here, and I encourage you to use the interactive nature of Jupyter to play around with the various parameters. Here are a few ideas:\n* Try chaging the hyperparameters to achieve a higher accuracy within fewer epochs. You use the comparison table on the Jovian.ml project page to compare your experiments.\n* Try adding more convolutional layers, or increasing the number of channels in each convolutional layer\n* Try using a feedforward neural network and see what's the maximum accuracy you can achieve\n* Read about some of the startegies mentioned above for reducing overfitting and achieving better results, and try to implement them by looking into the PyTorch docs.\n* Modify this notebook to train a model for a different dataset (e.g. CIFAR100 or ImageNet)\n\nIn the next tutorial, we will continue to improve our model's accuracy using techniques like data augmentation, batch normalization and dropout. We will also learn about residual networks (or ResNets), a small but critical change to the model architecture that will significantly boost the performance of our model. Stay tuned!","metadata":{}}]}
